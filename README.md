# Formula1Simulation
The Formula 1 trajectory simulation program is a software application designed to accurately simulate the movement of a Formula 1 race car on a specific curve. The program employs advanced physics algorithms to calculate the car's speed, acceleration, and trajectory, taking into account factors such as aerodynamic drag, tire grip, and engine power.
